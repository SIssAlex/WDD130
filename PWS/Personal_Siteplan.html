    <h3>Story & Characters</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Why the Story Matters:</strong>  
      Undertale’s story is what truly makes it memorable. The game starts with a child who falls into the Underground, a world filled with monsters. From this point, players can choose how they interact with every character—either through violence or kindness. The consequences of these choices create emotional depth rarely seen in games.

      <strong>Character Development:</strong>  
      Every major character is well-developed and meaningful. Players meet Papyrus, a silly skeleton who wants to join the Royal Guard; Sans, who hides depth behind his jokes; and Toriel, who acts as a mother figure. Your choices affect how they treat you and how the game ends.

      <strong>Emotional Connection:</strong>  
      The way Undertale makes you feel responsible for the emotional outcome sets it apart. Many players remember the emotional weight more than the gameplay itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay & Music</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Unique Combat:</strong>  
      Undertale features a unique combat system where you can attack or resolve conflict peacefully. In real-time, players dodge attacks using mini-games and patterns. This system keeps the player engaged in both gameplay and morality.

      <strong>Player Choice:</strong>  
      Actions have long-lasting effects—even if you restart the game. Undertale remembers what you did. This creates a meta-layer of storytelling unlike most RPGs.

      <strong>Iconic Soundtrack:</strong>  
      Toby Fox’s soundtrack is one of the most iconic in indie gaming. Songs like “Megalovania,” “Hopes and Dreams,” and “His Theme” are instantly recognizable. The soundtrack enhances every mood and is part of why fans love and remember the game.
