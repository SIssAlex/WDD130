    <h3>Story & Characters</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Why the Story Matters:</strong>  
      Undertale’s story is what truly makes it memorable. The game starts with a child who falls into the Underground, a world filled with monsters. From this point, players can choose how they interact with every character—either through violence or kindness. The consequences of these choices create emotional depth rarely seen in games.

      <strong>Character Development:</strong>  
      Every major character is well-developed and meaningful. Players meet Papyrus, a silly skeleton who wants to join the Royal Guard; Sans, who hides depth behind his jokes; and Toriel, who acts as a mother figure. Your choices affect how they treat you and how the game ends.

      <strong>Emotional Connection:</strong>  
      The way Undertale makes you feel responsible for the emotional outcome sets it apart. Many players remember the emotional weight more than the gameplay itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay & Music</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Unique Combat:</strong>  
      Undertale features a unique combat system where you can attack or resolve conflict peacefully. In real-time, players dodge attacks using mini-games and patterns. This system keeps the player engaged in both gameplay and morality.

      <strong>Player Choice:</strong>  
      Actions have long-lasting effects—even if you restart the game. Undertale remembers what you did. This creates a meta-layer of storytelling unlike most RPGs.

      <strong>Iconic Soundtrack:</strong>  
      Toby Fox’s soundtrack is one of the most iconic in indie gaming. Songs like “Megalovania,” “Hopes and Dreams,” and “His Theme” are instantly recognizable. The soundtrack enhances every mood and is part of why fans love and remember the game.

<h3>Story & Characters</h3>

<section>
  <h4>The Story of Undertale</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Undertale</strong> begins with a mysterious yet simple premise: a human child accidentally falls into the Underground—a world sealed off from humanity, inhabited by monsters who were once banished after a great war.
  </p>
  <p>
    The player navigates this strange land, encountering a diverse cast of characters who react dynamically to your choices. What sets Undertale apart is its unique moral system: you can choose to fight or show mercy, and these choices influence not only dialogue and events—but entire endings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game has three primary paths: <strong>Pacifist</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, and <strong>Genocide</strong>. Each reveals different truths about the world and its characters, offering a level of emotional resonance and narrative replayability rarely seen in games.

    <li><strong>Frisk:</strong> The silent protagonist whose actions define the story. Are you a bringer of peace, or destruction?</li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Emotional Themes</h4>
  <p>
    Undertale thrives on emotional storytelling. Every character, no matter how silly or strange, has depth. The game explores friendship, loss, regret, redemption, and the burden of choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you spare or destroy, Undertale never forgets—and neither will you.

    <h5>Combat That Makes You Think</h5>
    <img src="../PWS/image/undertale-frisk-6fk4eobq81a4a50g.jpg" alt="Battle Screenshot" style="width:300px;" />
    <p>
      Unlike traditional RPGs, Undertale allows you to choose whether to fight or show mercy. Every enemy encounter is a moral test: Will you destroy your foes or find a way to understand and spare them?
    </p>
    <p>
      In combat, players dodge incoming attacks in a "bullet-hell" style mini-game. The variety of attacks keeps players on their toes and adds excitement even in non-violent runs.

    <h5>Multiple Play Styles</h5>

    <p>
      Undertale supports three main routes: <strong>Pacifist</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, and <strong>Genocide</strong>. Each one tells a drastically different story depending on the player’s choices.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pacifist:</strong> Befriend everyone. No one dies. Discover the deepest lore and most hopeful ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> A mix of choices. The ending depends on who lived or died.</li>
      <li><strong>Genocide:</strong> Kill every character. Face intense battles and discover the darkest parts of the story.</li>
