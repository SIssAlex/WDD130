        <h3>Combat That Makes You Think</h3>

        <p>
          Unlike traditional RPGs, Undertale allows you to choose whether to fight or show mercy. Every enemy encounter is a moral test: Will you destroy your foes or find a way to understand and spare them?
        </p>
        <p>
          In combat, players dodge incoming attacks in a "bullet-hell" style mini-game. The variety of attacks keeps players on their toes and adds excitement even in non-violent runs.

        <p>
          Undertale supports three main routes: <strong>Pacifist</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, and <strong>Genocide</strong>. Each one tells a drastically different story depending on the player’s choices.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pacifist:</strong> Befriend everyone. No one dies. Discover the deepest lore and most hopeful ending.</li>
          <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> A mix of choices. The ending depends on who lived or died.</li>
          <li><strong>Genocide:</strong> Kill every character. Face intense battles and discover the darkest parts of the story.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Undertale remembers what you do—even after resetting. Characters may comment on past actions from different playthroughs, making each decision feel permanent and significant. This "fourth wall awareness" is one of the game's standout features.

          The soundtrack of Undertale is not just background noise—it's part of the emotional journey. Each song reflects the personality of the moment, from haunting melodies to pulse-pounding boss themes.

          <li><strong>Hopes and Dreams:</strong> An uplifting battle anthem during the Pacifist route's final boss.</li>
          <li><strong>His Theme:</strong> A deeply emotional track that perfectly complements the game’s most tender scenes.</li>

        <h3>Why the Music Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Fans often revisit the soundtrack long after finishing the game. It evokes strong memories of the characters, choices, and emotions experienced. In many ways, the music is as memorable as the story itself.
