      <h2>The Story of Undertale</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Undertale</strong> begins with a mysterious yet simple premise: a human child accidentally falls into the Underground—a world sealed off from humanity, inhabited by monsters who were once banished after a great war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player navigates this strange land, encountering a diverse cast of characters who react dynamically to your choices. What sets Undertale apart is its unique moral system: you can choose to fight or show mercy, and these choices influence not only dialogue and events—but entire endings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game has three primary paths: <strong>Pacifist</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, and <strong>Genocide</strong>. Each reveals different truths about the world and its characters, offering a level of emotional resonance and narrative replayability rarely seen in games.
